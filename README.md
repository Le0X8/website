# My _new_ website

This is my new website. It's going to be awesome and way cleaner than the old one.

I also translated the website to German.

The website uses SvelteKit to build the website. Maybe you could use some parts of the code for your own website, if you give me credit.

The old website is still available at [leox.dev](https://leox.dev/), maybe the main website will be changed to the new one soon.
